Guten tag!

I'm a newbie to the coding world with an amateur amount of HTML and CSS picked up during a career as an SEO. Right now I'm fiddling around with CTF games to learn some infosec and boning up on HTML5 as well as Javascript. I don't know why you're reading this, but any input or advice is welcome.

Compute happy.
